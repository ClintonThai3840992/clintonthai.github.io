          <h2><i>All about my where I am looking to work at!</i></h2>

          <p>Upon searching on job search websites, this particular job listing stood out for me:</p>

          </div>

          <h2><i>Milanote Overview</i></h2>

          <p>Milanote is offering the position of a Full Stack Developer. What that means to me is that
          I will be able to work using the software development methodology (Analysis, Design, Development, Evaluation)
          to create or work on an existing product for the company. This includes front-end, back-end and deployment using
          AWS of said application. This position offer intrigued me in the sense that the company is a small startup with
          great people, meaning that I will be hopefully be able to collaborate very closely and form great bonds with everyone.
          I also have some minimal experience in React and Javascript, as I was a tester for the group project within the
          class Software Engineering: Processes and Tools. Finally, the pay is also very attractive at $140k-$170k a year plus
          super too. This also relates to them stating that the hours are quite flexible, and everyone sometimes goes out for
          team bondings. </p>

            </div>
          </div>

          <h2><i>Skill Requirements</i></h2>

          <p>The skills required are Javascript/React for the Front-end development. The back-end skills required are MongoDB,
          Node/Express, Redis, Sockets and REST/API Design. As for the deployment of the application, they use AWS Architecture
          as well as for security. There are other important skills as well, such as turning front-end performance using JS Profiling,
          experience in Functional Programming and Sass. Although all these various skills are listed, they say that the candidate
          is not required to know all of it as they are open to teaching the skills, which is also what makes the job opportunity
          attractive too. </p>

          <h2><i>Skills that I Currently Have</i></h2>

          <p>Currently, I am not that experienced in Full Stack Development. I only have experience in Java development, as well as a bit of
          Python and C++. In terms of testing, I kind of know how to do it for the back-end using JUnit as well as in the front-end using Jest.
          I also have a bit of experience in regards to Javascript and React as I worked as the tester for a group project. </p>
