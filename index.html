    <h1>Personal Information</h1>

      <p>Once again, my name is Clinton Thai. I have half Vietnamese and Chinese blood flowing through my veins
      In 2018, my family and I moved here to the wonderful city of Melbourne, Australia.
      However, I was actually born and raised in the suburb of Mangere which is located in Auckland, New Zealand.
      Because of my mixed origins, I am able to speak three languages, English!, Vietnamese and Teochew (Chinese Dialect).</p>

      <p>Since my move to Melbourne, I have completed VCE in 2018, 2019, and then started of tertiary schooling
      by studying a Bachelors of Computer Science in 2020, 2021, and then transferred to Bachelors of IT in 2022.</p>

      <p>Outside of studying, there are many things that I enjoy. Most of my spare time is spent either with my partner,
      or on my PC playing games. Back in the day, I played a lot of CS:GO, and so when Valorant was released, I played
      a lot of that to this day. I also enjoy going to the gym and shooting some hoops at the local basketball courts!</p>

      <p>Finally, let me introduce you to my pet dog named Yoshi, which is an Australian Shepherd breed and he is a bit special! (insert picture)</p>
