Personal Information
Once again, my name is Clinton Thai. I have half Vietnamese and Chinese blood flowing through my veins.
In 2018, my family and I moved here to the wonderful city of Melbourne, Australia.
However, I was actually born and raised in the suburb of Mangere which is located in Auckland, New Zealand.
Since my move to Melbourne, I have completed VCE in 2018, 2019, and then started of tertiary schooling
by studying a Bachelors of Computer Science in 2020, 2021, and then transferred to Bachelors of IT in 2022.
I am able to speak three languages, English!, Vietnamese and Teochew (Chinese Dialect).
Outside of studying, there are many things that I enjoy. Most of my spare time is spent either with my partner,
or on my PC playing games. Back in the day, I played a lot of CS:GO, and so when Valorant was released, I played
a lot of that to this day. I also enjoy going to the gym and shooting some hoops at the local courts!
Let me introduce you to my pet dog named Yoshi, which is an Australian Shepherd breed and he is a bit special! (insert picture)

Interest in IT

What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start?
Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).

Personally, my interest in IT is within software development, testing and possibly data analytics!
My interest in the IT field actually derives from when I was a young child. My uncle introduced me to PC gaming,
where from there I eventually learnt how to build a PC, and then ended up actually doing it myself.
My love for gaming and technology was nurtured due to my early exposure to it.
Since then, I have been the 'tech' guy in my family and friend groups, whereby if there are any
technology related issues, they would come to me for assistance.
Fast-forward to VCE, I decided to take Units 1-4 of Software Engineering, where I learnt how to code in Java
and followed the software engineering process to create my own basic software (which was very bad), but I learnt a lot!

Why did you choose to come to RMIT?

There are multiple reasons why I chose RMIT.
First of all, just from open days as well as word of mouth, RMIT seemed to have the best courses for the IT field.
RMIT just seemed like the perfect option for me, because I wanted to get into a Bachelors of Computer Science,
which I luckily did successfully so.
Another big reason as to why I chose RMIT was that the location is very easy to get to for me (One train ride),
as well as being in the center of the Melbourne CBD.

What do you expect to learn during your studies?
