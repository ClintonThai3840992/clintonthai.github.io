          <h1>Project Idea - Film/Book Tracker</h1>
          <h2><i>Overview</i></h2>

          <p>Majority, if not everyone has watched a movie or read a book at least once in their lifetimes. This project
          takes us through the idea of creating a book/movie tracker whereby users are able to keep track of their entertainment
          media history. </p>

            <div class="caption"><i>What was the movie I watched as a kid again?</i></div>
          </div>

          <h2><i>Motivation</i></h2>

          <p>Entertainment. It is a big part of everyone's lives whether it be movies, books, music, podcasts and games. However,
          these days, it is so easy to consume these materials. All that is needed are a device and internet connection. Services such as
          Netflix, Booktopia and Binge have endless amounts of movies and books, that people generally struggle to run out of entertainment
          options. As a result of mass media consumption, people tend to forget the shows they have watched, or the books they have read.
          Quoting Julie Beck from (theatlantic.com),</p>

          <p style="text-align: center"><i><b>“The experience of consuming culture is like filling up a bathtub, soaking in it, and then
          watching the water run down the drain”.</b></i></p>

          <h2><i>Description</i></h2>

          <p>The proposed solution is a mobile/web application in which as a user watches a movie or reads a book, they can add that towards their
          ever-growing personal list, as well as keep track of number of episodes watched, give ratings and write personal reviews or synopsis. If
          they ever need to recall a movie/book, it is all in their database with a blurb and rating to help them recall how good it was. </p>

          <p>The process is as follows. The user is either currently or have completed watching/reading their media. They want to submit/update their
          progress. They open up the application, then press a button for a new entry. They are then prompted to enter the relevant details of the
          media such as name, director/author, episodes watched, pages read, rating and description/review/synopsis. They could also possibly upload
          an image as well, such as the cover photo or snapshot of a specific enticing scene. They then submit the entry, and it will reflect on their
          watch/read list. After that, the user is not only able to view their media history, but also edit the entry for the instances where they watched
          new episodes or read more pages.</p>

          <p>Aside from personal use, users may also be able to share their individual entries, or their complete lists so that other friends/family can view it.
          This could possibly be achieved through storage of entries into a CSV, in which the application can export and import CSV files. </p>

          <h2><i>Tools and Technologies</i></h2>

          <p>The tools and technologies required are: computer, IDE and chose coding language or text editor. This project can probably be implemented using either
          Java or Python however it might be the simplest to implement is as a website using HTML and CSS. The chosen language must be coupled together with any IDE
          such as IntelliJ or Visual Studio, and Atom or Notepad++ for HTML/CSS. Other than that, an appropriate device with recent specs and running any recent
          operating systems such as Windows 10/11 or any recent macOS. </p>

          <h2><i>Skills Required</i></h2>

          <p>The developer/s should be reasonably skilled in whichever coding language they choose. If it is Java or Python, it may be a bit more difficult as they would
          have to code the application logic as well as creating the user interface. Not only that, but they also must work with CSV file manipulation
          (import, export, read and write) which all require more skill and competency from the developer/s. Even more advanced, the developer/s may decide to create
          the frontend using JavaScript, and then code the backend on Java. Some skill is also needed to implement the idea onto a website using HTML/CSS as the user
          interface may be simpler, but the logic and file manipulation is still required. Although a fair amount of skill is required, it is nothing too
          farfetched/tech-company ready level. It is quite feasible to find the skills. No special hardware is required, and IDEs/Text editors are free software. </p>

          <h2><i>Outcome</i></h2>
          <p>Once the project has been successfully implemented, many users are able to reliably have a website/application to refer to, to create a personal media history.
          Many users online who have forgotten an old movie, and only remember some small part of the movie may be able to search through their list and find it without
          having to go through the painful experience of trying to google it based on a vague memory. Users who are watching long series or reading long books may also
          use the website/application as a bookmark, where they can update their progress, and come back to it in the future being able to find out where they last left
          off. This development is not a large and probably necessary one in retrospect to the many innovative applications that have been created, however it suits more
          as being a quality of life improvement for many users. </p>
