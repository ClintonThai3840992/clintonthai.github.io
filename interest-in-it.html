          <h1>Interest in Information Technology</h1>
          <h2><i>All about my interest in IT!</i></h2>

          <p>Personally, my interest in IT is within software development, testing and possibly data analytics!
          My interest in the IT field actually derives from when I was a young child. My uncle introduced me to PC gaming,
          where from there I eventually learnt how to build a PC, and then ended up actually doing it myself.
          My love for gaming and technology was nurtured due to my early exposure to it. Since then,
          I have been the 'tech' guy in my family and friend groups, whereby if there are any technology related issues,
          they would come to me for assistance. Fast-forward to VCE, I decided to take Units 1-4 of Software Engineering,
          where I learnt how to code in Java and followed the software engineering process to create my own basic software
          (which was very bad), but I learnt a lot! </p>

          <p>Fun fact: I love building computers and custom mechanical keyboards!</p>

            <div class="caption"><i>My custom mechanical keyboard build!</i></div>
          </div>

          <h2><i>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</i></h2>

          <p>There are multiple reasons why I chose RMIT. First of all, just from open days as well as word of mouth,
          RMIT seemed to have the best courses for the IT field. RMIT just seemed like the perfect option for me,
          because I wanted to get into a Bachelors of Computer Science, which I luckily did successfully so.
          Another big reason as to why I chose RMIT was that the location is very easy to get to for me (one train ride),
          as well as being in the center of the Melbourne CBD. </p>

          <h2><i>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</i></h2>

          <p>Prior to the commencement of my studies, I expected to learn mainly just the Software Development process,
          as well as a bunch of coding languages. What surprised me though was that in Computer Science, there are (surprisingly)
          a lot of science related subjects that go hand-in-hand with computers. Some examples of science-y classes that I completed
          was Discrete Structures (Maths) and Intro to Data Analytics (Python and Statistics). </p>
