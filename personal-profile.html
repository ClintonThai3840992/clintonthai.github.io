          <h2><i>All about diving deep into my personality!</i></h2>

          <p>Lets begin analysing my personality (as these tests would determine!) The first test that I conducted is called
          the <a href="https://www.16personalities.com">Myers-Brigs Type Indicator.</a></p>

          </div>

          <p>Upon the completion of the Myers-Briggs Test, the results did surprise me. What stood out to me was my Assertive rating,
          which was at 69%. In my opinion, I am not a very assertive person as I am a people please, so that way I see myself,
          I always do things in the interests of others in order to keep them happy. However, every other rating I would agree with. </p>

          <p>These three test results are all quite accurate and do reflect my personality and behaviour quite well.
          The Myers-Briggs test and Big 5 Factors test both conclude that being extroverted is one of my personality traits,
          which I do agree with as I love meeting people and making new friends, also am pretty good at conversing with others.
          The Big 5 Factors test say that my strongest trait is that I am very emotionally stable which is true because I am a very
          patient person that doesnâ€™t get stressed very easily. Also, according to the Nerdy Personality Test, I am apparently in the
          lower ends of nerds, where I am very much not a nerd, which I think is funny because gaming, anime and manga is a big thing
          in my life. Because these results show that I am very outgoing, I think that means that I will be able to bond very well with my
          teammates. I am probably very easy to work with because of my agreeableness and emotional stability, which help in my stress
          management as well as everyone else. One thing I do not agree on though, is my assertiveness score of 69% in the Myers-Briggs test,
          because personally I think I am not assertive enough, which makes me out to be someone that is not quite cut out to be a leader.
          Meaning that when forming a team, I will most likely not take up the leadership role. </p>
